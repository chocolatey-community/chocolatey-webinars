though it has been renamed to minimize changes to the package scripts between versions.

You can verify this by:

- Navigating to https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases
- Finding the package version
- Downloading the monaspace-<Version>.zip file
- Using `Get-FileHash` to get the SHA256 hash of the downloaded file
- Comparing the value to the hash of the zip in this package
