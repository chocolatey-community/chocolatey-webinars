# Script packages

Chocolatey packages are built on PowerShell. This means that anything you can do in PowerShell, you can do in a Chocolatey package.
Because we can do anything PowerShell can do, we don't _have_ to install software using a Chocolatey Package. This opens up the
following use-cases:

- Configuration: Replace complex setup steps with a single configuration package. Use dependencies to pair application
intall with application configuration. Add flexibility with Package Parameters!
- Data sharing: Easily ensure files and folders required by a system, and version them too!
- Dot-source bundled scripts and execute them as needed

Script packages provide ultimate flexibility to suit any need.
